# 🕵️ Zenith Absolute: World-Class Forensic Workflow

This document outlines the elite "Triple-A" journey: **Acquisition → Analysis → Adjudication**.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Acquisition (Integrity & Origin)

1. **Ingestion**: Navigate to `/ingestion`.
2. **Secure Intake**: Upload your dataset.
3. **The Digital Signature**: Observe the "Notary Token" being generated.
    * *System Logic*: The platform calculates a SHA-256 hash immediately to ensure the evidence is "sealed."
    * *Success Metric*: You see a green checkmark: `Evidence Authenticated`.

## 🔍 Phase 2: Analysis (Contextual Intelligence)

1. **Discovery**: Navigate to `/forensic/hub`.
2. **The Chronicle (NEW)**: Switch to the "Timeline" view.
    * *Observation*: You see events from the **Map** and **Nexus Graph** merged into a single chronological thread.
3. **AI Insight**: Frenly (AI Assistant) flags a "Velocity Spike" where high-value transactions correlate with a specific geographic location.
4. **Injection**: Click **"Push to Case"** on the flagged anomaly.
    * *Action*: Assign an **Exhibit ID** (e.g., `EXE-104`).

## ⚖️ Phase 3: Adjudication (The Verdict)

1. **The Bench**: Navigate to `/investigate` (or click Gavel Icon).
2. **Select Case**: Open your active investigation.
3. **Exhibit Review**:
    * Look at the "Adjudication Bench" tab.
    * **Action**: Review Exhibit `EXE-104`.
    * **Verdict**: Click **"ADMIT"** to include it in the final legal narrative.
4. **Narrative Synthesis**:
    * The AI auto-drafts a report paragraph: *"Evidence EXE-104 confirms a direct link between Vendor X and the anomalous capital outflow detected in the North Sector..."*

## 📄 Phase 4: Closure (The Report)

1. **Final Seal**: Click **"Seal Case"**.
2. **Export**: Download the **Consolidated Forensic Dossier** (Markdown/PDF).
    * *Verification*: The report includes an **Appendix** with all raw hashes for legal admissibility.
