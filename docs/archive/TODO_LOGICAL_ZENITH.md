# Zenith V4: The Logical Forensic Protocol 🛡️

This roadmap focuses on pivoting Zenith from "Tactical Fantasy" to a **Logical, Data-Driven Audit Powerhouse**.

## Summary Status

- [x] **Refine Dashboard UX**: Replace terms and icons with audit-professional counterparts.
- [x] **Sidebar Sync**: Update all tool labels in the sidebar to remove military jargon.
- [x] **Truth Alignment (Visual Audit)**: Refactored Satellite to logical Progress Audit.
- [x] **Voucher Logic Bridge**: Connected Lab anomalies to the Verdict Engine.
- [x] **Forensic Weighting System**: Implemented Logic-based scoring and attribution.
- [x] **Infrastructure & Autopilot**: Implemented Audit Trigger Bus in Ingestion and Sync in Command.

## 1. Terminology & UI Logic (De-Gimmicking) [COMPLETE]

- [x] **Shift Workspace Branding**: Done in `app/page.tsx` and `app/components/ForensicSidebar.tsx`.
- [x] **Refine Dashboard UX**: "Live Pulse" -> "Risk Summary Ticker", "Operational Focus" -> "Audit Context".
